# What is it, and why should I care?

---

# Clojure

- It's a dialect of Lisp
- It runs on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
- Can use Java libraries
- Encourages *immutable* data structures
- This makes it ideal for concurrency
- Very simple syntax

---

class: inverse
# Clojure(script) example

    (defn my-function [x y]
        (let [xs (* x x) ys (* y y)]
            (Math/sqrt (+ xs ys))))

---

class: inverse
# Clojure(script) example

    (defn my-function [x y]
        (let [xs (* x x) ys (* y y)]
            (Math/sqrt (+ xs ys))))

    var my-function = function(x, y) {
        var xs = x * x;
        var ys = y * y;
        return sqrt(xs + ys);
    }

# OK, so what's Lisp?

---

# Lisp

- One of the oldest programming languages
- Designed in 1958 (!) by John McCarthy
- Multi-paradigm (esp. functional programming)
- Encourages meta-programming
- Most popular dialects: Common Lisp, Scheme
- ...and now Clojure!

# Benefits of Using Clojure

---

# Client & Server Code Sharing

- Clojure runs on the JVM => server.
- ClojureScript compiles to highly optimized Javascript => client.
- They are (basically) the same language, so code can be shared between client and server

---

# Small & Agile Philosophy

- Clojure follows the UNIX philosophy
- *minimalist, modular software development*: do one thing, do it well.
- Small libraries composed together, not large monolithic frameworks (Spring / Rails).
- Helps to avoid lock-in

# Handling of State

.column[

- Clojure is designed to be immutable by default
- Useful for concurrency / parallel programming
- Gives more control over state
- See Paul's book for more detail
]

# React

.center[![Default-aligned image](img/react-sm.png)]

- New approach to handling Javascript UI code
- Inspired by ideas from functional programming
- "Virtual DOM" approach
- Some complexity involved, however
- ClojureScript's "reagent" can simplify this

---

# Developer Experience

- "Simple Made Easy"
- REPL-driven development
- Many tools for interactive coding

---

# That's it
