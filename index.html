# What is it, and why should I care?

---

# Clojure

- It's a dialect of Lisp
- It runs on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
- Can use Java libraries
- Encourages *immutable* data structures
- This makes it ideal for concurrency
- Very simple syntax

---

# ClojureScript

- Compiles to Javascript
- Runs in the browser
- Also runs on servers (through node.js)
- Runs on mobile devices (through React Native)

---

# OK, so what's Lisp?

---

# Lisp

- One of the oldest programming languages
- Designed in 1958 (!) by John McCarthy
- Multi-paradigm (esp. functional programming)
- Encourages meta-programming
- Most popular dialects: Common Lisp, Scheme
- ...and now Clojure!

class: inverse

# Clojure(script) example

    (defn my-function [x y]
      (Math/sqrt (+ (* x x) (* y y))))

---

class: inverse
# Clojure(script) example

    (defn my-function [x y]
      (Math/sqrt (+ (* x x) (* y y))))

    var my-function = function(x, y) {
        return sqrt((x * x) + (y * y));
    }

# Benefits of Using Clojure

---

# Client & Server Code Sharing

- Clojure runs on the JVM => server.
- ClojureScript compiles to highly optimized Javascript => client.
- They are (basically) the same language, so code can be shared between client and server
- This is very useful for re-using validation code (for example)
- We can make good use of JVM and JS ecosystems

---

# Small & Agile Philosophy

- Clojure follows the UNIX philosophy
- *minimalist, modular software development*: do one thing, do it well.
- Small libraries composed together, not large monolithic frameworks (Spring / Rails).
- But also the benefit of an excellent standard library
- Helps to avoid lock-in

---

# Interactive Development

- Clojure (and Lisp) encourages *REPL-driven development*
- You can make changes to your code and see the changes immediately
- Very useful to have this tight feedback loop and not have to keep restarting the program
- Excellent for prototyping, building on a working program incrementally

# Handling of State

.column[

- Clojure is designed to be immutable by default
- Useful for concurrency / parallel programming
- Gives more control over state
- See Paul's book for more detail
]

# A Joke About Side Effects

- What's 5 plus 2?
- 7
- What's 5 plus 3?
- 8
- Nope. It’s 10, because we turned 5 into 7, remember?

(Now I will explain the joke)

# Why Functional Programming?

- Side-effects are a huge source of complexity
- Functional programming avoids side-effects
- It does this through encouraging *immutability*
- Object-oriented programming *encourages* the use of side effects!

---

# React

.center[![Default-aligned image](img/react-sm.png)]

- New approach to handling Javascript UI code
- Inspired by ideas from functional programming
- "Virtual DOM" approach
- Some complexity involved, however
- ClojureScript's "reagent" can simplify this

---

# Developer Experience

.center[![Default-aligned image](img/immediate_code_sm.png)]

- "Simple Made Easy"
- REPL-driven development
- Many tools for interactive coding
- Examples: figwheel, re-frisk, devcards (which I will now demo)
